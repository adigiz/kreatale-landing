# How Search Works in 2026 (And What It Means for Your Business Website)

The way people find businesses online has changed significantly in the past two years. If your website was built before 2024 and hasn't been updated, it was designed for a search landscape that no longer exists.

This article covers what's changed, what it means in practice, and what you can do about it.

## What Changed

### Google Results Look Different Now

When someone searches for a service in 2026 — say "web developer Bali" or "best plumber near me" — the Google results page has a lot more going on than it used to.

At the top, there's often an **AI Overview**: a paragraph generated by Google that summarizes the answer using information pulled from multiple websites. Below that, you'll see Google Maps results, YouTube videos, Reddit discussions, "People Also Ask" boxes, and then — further down — the traditional website links.

The data on this is clear: click-through rates for the #1 organic position have dropped about 34% when an AI Overview appears. That's not because fewer people are searching. It's because Google is answering the question directly on the results page.

### People Search With AI Directly

A growing segment of users skip Google entirely and use AI tools to search. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude — these tools take a question, find relevant sources, synthesize an answer, and cite where the information came from.

The numbers are significant: AI-referred traffic to websites has grown over 500% in recent months. ChatGPT alone handles around 72 billion messages per month. When someone asks "how much does it cost to build an ecommerce website in Australia," the AI gives an answer and cites its sources. Those sources get the traffic.

One finding that's particularly relevant: 90% of ChatGPT's citations come from websites **outside** the top 20 traditional Google results. So a site that doesn't rank well on Google can still get significant traffic from AI citations if its content is well-structured.

### This Is Called GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

Researchers at Princeton and Georgia Tech introduced this term in 2023, and by 2026 it's become a standard part of digital marketing vocabulary. GEO is the practice of structuring your content so that AI engines are more likely to cite it.

The core principles are different from traditional SEO:

- **Direct answers over keyword stuffing.** AI engines prefer content that answers a question clearly and completely. A page that directly states "A custom ecommerce website in Australia costs between $5,000 and $25,000 depending on complexity" performs better than a page that uses the keyword "ecommerce website Australia" fifteen times without giving a concrete answer.

- **Structured, parsable content.** Clear headings, tables, numbered lists, and proper HTML structure make it easier for AI systems to extract and cite specific information from your page.

- **Schema markup.** This is structured data in your page's code that tells search engines explicitly what your business does, where it's located, what services you offer, and how to contact you. Most template websites either don't implement this or implement it poorly.

- **Freshness.** AI engines weight recent content more heavily. A 2022 article about website costs is less likely to be cited than a 2026 article with current pricing.

- **Authority signals.** Original data, specific case studies with numbers, citations from credible sources. Wikipedia accounts for 47.9% of ChatGPT's most-cited sources — not because it's Wikipedia, but because it's factual, well-structured, and comprehensive.

The research indicates that implementing these techniques can improve visibility in AI-generated responses by up to 40%.

## What This Means for Business Websites

### Most Business Websites Are Built Like Brochures

The standard small business website has: a homepage with a hero image and tagline, an About page, a Services page, and a Contact page. Maybe a blog with 2–3 posts from when the site launched.

This structure made sense when Google was the main discovery channel and ranking for your business category + location was the goal. It's less effective now because:

1. **It doesn't answer questions.** AI engines and Google's AI Overviews are answering questions. A services page that says "We offer comprehensive web solutions" doesn't answer anything specific enough to be cited.

2. **It doesn't target search intent.** Your potential customers aren't searching for your company name (unless they already know about you). They're searching for their problem: "how to get more customers online," "website for restaurant in Jakarta," "do I need a mobile app for my business." If your site doesn't have content addressing those queries, you won't appear.

3. **It doesn't have enough content to rank.** Google and AI engines both need substantial, specific content to evaluate your authority on a topic. A 5-page website with 200 words per page doesn't give them enough to work with.

### What a Search-Optimized Site Looks Like in 2026

The structure shifts from "here's who we are" to "here's what we know about the things you're searching for."

**Service-specific pages** instead of one generic services page. Not "We offer web development, mobile development, and SEO" on a single page, but dedicated pages for each that go into detail about what's involved, what it costs, what the timeline looks like, and what to look for.

**Content that answers real questions.** What do your potential customers actually search for before they hire someone like you? Those questions should have answers on your website. A plumber should have content about common plumbing problems and when to call a professional. A web studio should have content about what websites cost and how to evaluate developers.

**Technical foundations.** Fast page loads (under 2 seconds), proper schema markup, clean URL structure, XML sitemap, mobile-first design. These are table stakes for search visibility, both in Google and in AI engines. This is where template sites and AI-generated sites tend to fall short — they produce working pages, but the underlying code structure, schema implementation, and server-side rendering configuration are often either missing or poorly done. These are the things that determine whether search engines treat your site as a credible source.

**Design with intent.** There's also a visual element to credibility. Template and AI-generated sites tend to look interchangeable — the same card grids, the same hero layouts, the same spacing patterns. A custom-designed site can structure information around how your specific audience thinks and browses, which affects both how long they stay and whether they convert. Design isn't decoration; it's how you organize information for a specific audience.

**Regular updates.** Search engines favor sites that are actively maintained. A blog post once a month is enough to signal activity. The content should be genuinely useful, not filler.

## Practical Steps

If you have an existing website and want to improve its search visibility:

1. **Test your page speed.** Go to [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and enter your URL. Anything below 70 on mobile needs attention. Image optimization and proper hosting are usually the quickest fixes.

2. **Check your schema markup.** Use Google's [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to see what structured data your site has. At minimum, you should have LocalBusiness or Organization schema with your name, address, services, and contact information.

3. **Search for your own service.** Google what your customers would Google. "Web design [your city]" or "[your service] near me." Where do you appear? What does the AI Overview say? Is your website one of the sources?

4. **Check AI search.** Ask ChatGPT or Perplexity a question that your potential customers might ask. See if your business comes up. If it doesn't, look at what sources the AI *does* cite — that'll tell you what kind of content you need.

5. **Look at your content objectively.** Does your website actually answer questions that potential customers have? Or does it just describe your company? There's a meaningful difference.

## Not Every Business Needs to Worry About This

If your customers primarily come from referrals, networking, or in-person channels, and your website is a supporting asset rather than a discovery tool, the standard brochure format is fine. Spending money on search optimization only makes sense if search is actually how your customers find businesses like yours.

The businesses where this matters most are service businesses in competitive markets, ecommerce, anyone targeting customers outside their immediate network, and businesses expanding into new regions or markets.

## Want to Know How Your Site Performs in AI Search?

If you read through the steps above and aren't sure where your site stands, we can help you figure it out. We've helped businesses improve their search visibility through both dedicated SEO projects (like [Land Sale Expert](/projects/land-sale-expert) and [Element Commercial](/projects/element-commercial) in Australia) and through building search-optimized websites from scratch.
