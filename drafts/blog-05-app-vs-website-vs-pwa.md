# Does Your Business Need a Mobile App, a Website, or Both?

This question comes up in almost every initial client conversation we have. The answer depends on what you're building and who it's for, but the short version: most businesses need a website first, and many don't need an app at all.

Here's how to figure out which applies to you.

## The Three Options

### Website

A website is accessible through any browser on any device. No download required. You update it once and everyone sees the new version immediately.

**Cost:** $0–25,000+ depending on approach (website builders start at ~$17/month, custom development starts around $3,000).

**Strengths:**
- Maximum reach — anyone with a browser can access it
- Search engines index it (Google, Bing, AI search tools)
- No app store approval process or fees
- Works across all devices
- Faster and cheaper to update than native apps

**Limitations:**
- Limited access to device hardware (camera, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS is available but limited)
- No push notifications in some browsers (Safari on iOS only recently added support)
- Requires internet connection (unless built as a PWA — see below)
- No presence in app stores

### Native Mobile App

A native app is built specifically for iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) or Android (Kotlin) and downloaded from the App Store or Google Play.

**Cost:** $15,000–100,000+ for a single platform. Double that if you need both iOS and Android. Cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter) reduce this but still cost more than a website.

**Strengths:**
- Full access to device capabilities (camera, sensors, Bluetooth, NFC, biometrics)
- Best performance for graphics-heavy or real-time applications
- Push notifications work reliably
- App store presence provides a discovery channel
- Works offline

**Limitations:**
- Expensive to build and maintain (two codebases if going native, or one with compromises if cross-platform)
- App store review process adds delays to updates
- Apple takes 15–30% of in-app purchases
- Users need to actively download and keep the app installed
- Average smartphone user installs zero new apps per month — getting people to download yours is a real challenge

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

A PWA is a website built with additional capabilities that make it behave more like a native app. Users can "install" it to their home screen from the browser, and it can work offline, send push notifications, and cache content locally.

**Cost:** Similar to a custom website — $3,000–15,000 depending on complexity. No app store fees.

**Strengths:**
- Single codebase works across all platforms
- Installable to home screen without app store
- Works offline (with proper service worker setup)
- Push notifications on most platforms
- No app store review process or fees
- Indexed by search engines like a regular website
- Users don't need to "download" anything

**Limitations:**
- Limited device hardware access compared to native apps
- iOS support is improving but still behind Android
- No app store presence (discovery depends on web traffic)
- Not suitable for games or heavy graphics

**Real-world examples:** Twitter/X Lite, Starbucks, Pinterest, and Spotify all use PWAs alongside or instead of native apps for certain markets.

## How to Decide

The decision comes down to three questions:

**1. What does the user need to do?**

If the primary actions are reading information, viewing a portfolio, submitting a form, booking an appointment, or making a purchase — a website handles all of these. You don't need an app for a restaurant menu, a service business portfolio, or even most ecommerce.

If the user needs camera access, real-time location tracking, Bluetooth device connectivity, offline-first functionality with syncing, or heavy graphics (games, AR/VR) — a native app is justified.

If you need something in between — offline access, installability, push notifications, but the core functionality is content and forms — a PWA covers it.

**2. How will people find you?**

If your customers discover you through search engines (Google, AI search) or social media links, a website is the right primary platform. Search engines don't index native apps. Someone Googling "plumber near me" will find your website, not your app.

If your users will use the product daily or weekly (fitness tracking, project management, messaging, ride-hailing), a native app makes sense because the ongoing relationship justifies the download.

**3. What's your budget?**

A working business website: $0–8,000.
A PWA: $3,000–15,000.
A native app (one platform): $15,000–100,000+.
A native app (both platforms): $30,000–200,000+.

For most small and medium businesses, the budget question answers itself. Build the website first, because it costs less, reaches more people, and handles most business needs. Consider an app later if user behavior justifies it.

## The Typical Path

For most businesses we work with, the progression looks like this:

1. **Start with a website.** Get found in search, present your services, capture leads or sell products. This is the foundation.
2. **Add PWA capabilities if needed.** If users would benefit from installing your site to their home screen, offline access, or push notifications, this can be added to an existing website without rebuilding.
3. **Build a native app only when you have a specific, validated reason.** Usually this means you have an existing user base that's asking for one, or your product genuinely requires device capabilities that a website/PWA can't provide.

Skipping step 1 and going straight to a native app is one of the most common (and expensive) mistakes we see startups make. An app with no users and no discoverability channel is just an expensive icon on your own phone.

## Building Your Online Presence?

At Kreatale, we build websites and web applications with Next.js, and we also develop mobile apps with React Native for clients who need both platforms. We've built everything from marketing websites ([Sy Grace](/projects/sy-grace), [Gala Esports](/projects/gala-esports)) to full web apps with user accounts and dashboards ([Gemoedje.nl](/projects/gemoedje), [Study Gorilla](/projects/study-gorilla)) to cross-platform mobile apps ([Max Up](/projects/max-up), [Neon](/projects/neon)).

If you're trying to figure out what your business actually needs — website, PWA, app, or some combination — we can help you work that out before you spend anything. The answer depends on your users, your budget, and what you're trying to accomplish, and we'd rather help you get that right than sell you something you don't need.
