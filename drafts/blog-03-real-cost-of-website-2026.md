# How Much Does a Website Cost in 2026? Pricing by Type and Approach

This is a pricing reference for anyone researching website costs in 2026. We've included both USD and IDR (Indonesian Rupiah) since we work with clients in both markets.

Prices reflect what we've seen across the industry as of February 2026 — from website builders to freelancers to agencies. We've included our own pricing where relevant for transparency.

## Summary

| Approach | Typical Cost | Timeline | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Website builder (Wix, Squarespace, Hostinger) | $0–200/month | Hours to days | Informational sites, basic ecommerce |
| AI builder (Lovable, Bolt, v0) | $0–25/month + hosting | Minutes to hours + refinement | Prototypes, MVPs, simple sites |
| Freelancer | $600–5,000 per project | 2–6 weeks | Small business sites, WordPress |
| Studio/agency | $3,000–25,000+ per project | 4–12 weeks | Custom sites, complex functionality |
| Enterprise agency | $25,000–150,000+ | 3–12 months | Large-scale applications, enterprise |

## Detailed Breakdown by Approach

### Website Builders

Website builders like Wix, Squarespace, and Hostinger provide templates, hosting, and a visual editor in one package. You don't need technical skills.

**Platform costs:**
- Hostinger Website Builder: from Rp23,900/month (~$1.50/month)
- Wix: $17–159/month (Rp265,000–Rp2,500,000/month)
- Squarespace: $16–52/month (Rp250,000–Rp810,000/month)

**What's included in most paid plans:**
- Hosting and SSL certificate
- Free domain for the first year (renewal is usually $10–25/year)
- Template library
- Basic SEO tools
- Mobile-responsive design
- Contact forms and basic analytics

**Additional costs to budget for:**
- Ecommerce features: usually require a higher-tier plan ($27–64/month on Wix)
- Premium apps/plugins: $0–100/month per app
- Domain renewal after year one: $10–25/year
- Custom email (yourname@yourdomain.com): $1–6/month per user

**Annual total for a basic business site:** $200–750/year (Rp3,100,000–Rp11,700,000/year)

### AI Code Generators

These tools generate actual React/TypeScript code from text descriptions. They're different from website builders because you get real source code that you can export, modify, and host anywhere.

**Tool costs:**
- Lovable: free tier (5 builds/day), $25/month paid
- Bolt.new: free tier (150K tokens/day), $20/month paid
- v0 (Vercel): free tier ($5/month credits), $20/month paid

**Additional costs:**
- Hosting: $0–20/month (Vercel and Netlify have free tiers for small sites)
- Domain: $10–20/year
- Database (if needed): Supabase free tier is usually sufficient for small projects, paid plans start at $25/month
- Someone to handle the last 20%: these tools consistently get about 80% of the way to production-ready. Budget for developer time to handle security, edge cases, and polish.

**Annual total for a simple site:** $0–300/year + developer time for refinement

**Important caveat:** the $0 price tag is real for basic sites, but it comes with the assumption that either (a) you don't need production-grade security and reliability, or (b) you have access to someone who can review and harden the generated code. For a personal portfolio or blog, (a) is fine. For anything handling customer data or payments, you need (b).

### Freelancers

Freelancer rates vary significantly by location and experience.

**Hourly rates (2026 averages):**
- Southeast Asia: $15–40/hour
- Eastern Europe: $25–60/hour
- Western Europe/Australia/US: $50–150/hour
- Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork: $5–85/hour (wide range)

**Fixed-price project rates:**
- Simple business website (5–7 pages, WordPress): $600–2,000
- Custom-designed business site with CMS: $2,000–5,000
- Ecommerce site (WooCommerce/Shopify): $2,000–8,000
- Web application with custom functionality: $5,000–15,000

**What to watch out for:**
- Ask what technology they'll use. A WordPress site with a premium theme is different from a custom-coded site, and the pricing should reflect that.
- Ask for PageSpeed scores on their previous work. Load your portfolio examples on your phone over mobile data.
- Clarify what "revisions" means. Two rounds of design revisions is standard; unlimited revisions usually means nobody's being clear about scope.
- Clarify who handles hosting, domain, and ongoing maintenance.

### Studios and Agencies

Studios are typically small teams (2–10 people) that handle design and development. Agencies are larger, often with project managers, strategists, and broader service offerings.

**Studio pricing (Kreatale's range for reference):**
- Marketing website (Next.js, custom design, CMS, SEO setup): $3,000–8,000 — examples: [Gala Esports](/projects/gala-esports), [Sy Grace](/projects/sy-grace)
- Ecommerce website (WooCommerce or custom): $5,000–12,000 — example: [Zushino](/projects/zushino)
- Web application with custom functionality: $8,000–20,000 — examples: [Gemoedje.nl](/projects/gemoedje), [Study Gorilla](/projects/study-gorilla)
- SEO optimization project: $1,000–3,000 + ongoing $500–1,500/month — examples: [Land Sale Expert](/projects/land-sale-expert), [Element Commercial](/projects/element-commercial)
- Multilingual site (adds ~30–50% to base cost)

**What's typically included in a studio project:**
- Research and strategy (target audience, competitor analysis, keyword research)
- Custom UI/UX design — tailored to your brand and audience, not a template or AI-generated layout. This is one of the main things you're paying for at this tier: a site that looks and feels like *your* business, with user flows designed around how your customers actually behave.
- Development and testing
- CMS so you can update content yourself
- Basic SEO setup (meta tags, schema markup, sitemap, performance optimization)
- 30 days of post-launch support

**On design specifically:** AI tools and templates produce layouts that work, but they draw from the same patterns. If you put five Lovable-generated sites or five Wix template sites next to each other, they have a recognizable sameness — the same card grids, hero sections, and spacing. A custom-designed site is built around your brand identity and your specific conversion goals. For businesses where trust and first impressions drive the sale (professional services, luxury, B2B, creative industries), that distinction matters.

**Large agency pricing:**
- Small business website: $10,000–30,000
- Mid-market website: $30,000–75,000
- Enterprise website or application: $75,000–150,000+

The price difference between studios and large agencies isn't always about quality. Agencies have higher overhead (offices, project managers, account managers) and longer timelines. For small-to-medium businesses, a studio usually offers better value.

## Costs That Tend to Surprise People

**Content.** The biggest source of project delays isn't development — it's waiting for the client to provide copy, photos, and brand assets. If you don't have these ready, budget $300–1,500 for a copywriter and $300–1,000 for photography. AI tools can help draft copy, but someone still needs to provide the specific facts about your business.

**Ongoing marketing.** A website with no traffic generates nothing. If search engine traffic matters to your business, budget at least $500/month for either content creation, SEO, or advertising. This is usually a larger ongoing cost than the website itself.

**The cost of waiting.** This one is hard to quantify but worth mentioning. If your current website converts visitors to leads at 1% and a new one would convert at 3%, every month of delay is lost revenue proportional to your traffic. For businesses getting even moderate traffic, the difference adds up.

## How to Approach Budgeting

If you're trying to decide how much to spend:

1. **Start with what the website needs to do.** If it's informational only, keep costs low. If it's supposed to generate leads or sales, treat it as a business investment and evaluate it by expected return.

2. **Allocate budget for traffic, not just the website.** A common mistake is spending the entire budget on building the site and having nothing left for marketing. A rough rule of thumb: if your total digital budget is X, spend 40–60% on the website and the rest on driving traffic to it.

3. **Factor in maintenance from the start.** WordPress sites need regular updates. Custom sites need less frequent but still occasional maintenance. Builder sites handle this for you but charge monthly.

4. **Get multiple quotes.** If you're hiring a freelancer or studio, get 2–3 quotes. Pay attention not just to price but to what's included — especially around SEO setup, content migration, post-launch support, and who owns the code.
