# When It's Time to Move From Wix or a Template Site to Custom Development

Most businesses start with a website builder or template, and that's the right call at the beginning. It's fast, cheap, and gets you online. But at some point, some businesses outgrow what a template can do. This article covers the signs, the process, and what to consider.

## Signs Your Current Site Has Become a Limitation

Not every business needs to migrate. If your template site works for your needs and you're not hitting walls, there's no reason to spend money on a rebuild. But these are the situations where the limitations become tangible:

**Your site is slow and you can't fix it.**
You've optimized images, reduced content, tried different templates, and your PageSpeed score is still stuck in the 50–70 range on mobile. This is usually a platform limitation — the builder's code overhead sets a performance floor you can't get below. If your business depends on search traffic, this performance gap directly affects your visibility and conversion rate.

**You need functionality the builder doesn't support.**
Maybe it's a custom booking system that integrates with your calendar software. A client portal where customers log in and see their project status. Complex product filtering for an ecommerce store with hundreds of SKUs. Multi-currency support. Integration with your CRM or inventory management system. Builders offer plugins and add-ons for common needs, but specific business logic requires custom work.

**You look like everyone else.**
Your competitors use the same builder and similar templates. Your site looks professional but interchangeable. For businesses where trust and first impressions drive the sale — consulting, professional services, luxury products, B2B — a generic look undermines credibility. Custom design built around your specific brand and audience creates a different impression than a template that thousands of other businesses also use.

**You're paying more for workarounds than you would for a custom site.**
This happens more often than people realize. You're on a premium builder plan ($50+/month), plus 3–4 paid plugins ($20–100/month each), plus a third-party booking tool ($30/month), plus a separate email marketing integration ($30/month). The monthly cost adds up to $200–400/month — which over two years exceeds the cost of a custom site that handles all of it natively.

**Your SEO has plateaued.**
You've done everything the builder allows — optimized titles, written meta descriptions, added alt text — but you can't implement proper schema markup, server-side rendering, or advanced technical SEO. Your competitors with custom sites rank higher, load faster, and show up in Google's AI Overviews while you don't.

**You're expanding to new markets or languages.**
Builder multilingual support is limited. Adding a second or third language often means maintaining duplicate pages manually, with limited control over hreflang tags and locale-specific SEO. Custom frameworks handle internationalization at a structural level, making it sustainable as you add markets.

## What Migration Actually Involves

Migrating from a builder to a custom site isn't as disruptive as it sounds. Here's the typical process:

### 1. Audit the Current Site
What works, what doesn't, what content exists, what needs rewriting. Map all existing URLs (this is important for preserving any SEO equity you've built).

### 2. Plan the New Site
Sitemap, content strategy, feature requirements, technology selection. This is the phase where you address everything the old site couldn't do.

### 3. Design
Custom design built for your brand and audience. Unlike a template migration where you pick a new template, custom design starts from your specific goals: what should the user do on each page, what information do they need, what's the path from landing to contacting you or purchasing.

### 4. Development
Build the new site on the chosen technology. During this phase, the old site stays live — there's no downtime.

### 5. Content Migration
Move existing content (text, images, blog posts, product listings) to the new site. Some of this can be automated, some requires manual work, especially if you're improving the content during the transition.

### 6. Redirect Setup
Every URL from the old site needs a 301 redirect to the corresponding URL on the new site. This preserves your Google ranking for those pages and ensures anyone who bookmarked or linked to an old URL still reaches the right content. Skipping this step means losing whatever search equity your old site had built up.

### 7. Launch and Monitor
Switch the domain to the new site, verify redirects, monitor search performance for the first few weeks to catch any issues.

## What It Costs

Migration projects are typically in the $3,000–10,000 range for small-to-medium business sites, depending on:
- Number of pages
- Complexity of functionality
- Whether content needs rewriting
- Number of languages
- Ecommerce requirements (product count, payment integrations)

This is a one-time cost. Monthly hosting and maintenance for a custom site typically runs $20–300/month, compared to the $50–400/month many businesses end up paying for builder plans plus plugins plus workarounds.

**The math often favors migration within 12–18 months** when you account for: the monthly cost savings on plugins and workarounds, the conversion rate improvement from better performance, and the increased search traffic from better SEO capabilities.

## What Not to Do

**Don't migrate just because someone told you custom is "better."** If your template site serves your business well, generates leads, and doesn't cause problems, there's no reason to spend money rebuilding it.

**Don't lose your URLs.** The biggest technical mistake in migrations is not setting up proper 301 redirects. This causes search engines to lose track of your pages, and any links pointing to your old URLs (from other sites, social media, email campaigns) will break.

**Don't expect immediate SEO improvements.** Migration done correctly preserves your existing search performance. Improvements come over the following weeks and months as Google recrawls and re-evaluates the faster, better-structured site. There's sometimes a temporary dip in the first 1–2 weeks as search engines adjust — this is normal.

**Don't try to change everything at once.** Migrate first, then iterate. Launching a new design, new content, new functionality, and new URL structure simultaneously makes it impossible to diagnose issues if something goes wrong. Move to the new platform with your existing content, then make improvements incrementally.

## Thinking About Migrating?

At Kreatale, we've handled migrations from Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, and other platforms to Next.js. You can see the results in projects like [Gala Club](/projects/gala-club) (WordPress redesign for a gaming café chain) and [Plumbing](/projects/plumbing) (custom Next.js build for a service business). We manage the full process: audit, planning, design, development, content migration, redirect setup, and post-launch monitoring.

Every migration includes custom design (not a template swap), CMS setup so you can manage content yourself, SEO configuration including schema markup and proper redirects, and 30 days of post-launch support.

If you're hitting the limits of your current platform and want to understand what a migration would involve and cost for your specific site, we're happy to do an initial assessment.
