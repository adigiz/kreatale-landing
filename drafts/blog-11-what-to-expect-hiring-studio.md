# What to Expect When You Hire a Web Development Studio

If you've decided to invest in a custom website, the process of actually working with a development studio can feel opaque. How long does it take? What do you need to provide? What are the stages? When do you pay?

This article walks through what a typical studio engagement looks like, based on how we work at Kreatale and what's standard across the industry. If you're comparing proposals from different studios, this gives you a baseline for what to expect.

## Before the Project Starts

### Initial Conversation (Free, 15–30 minutes)

Most studios start with a discovery call. This isn't a sales pitch — it's where the studio figures out whether they can help you and gives you a chance to assess whether you'd want to work with them.

You should come prepared to discuss:
- What your business does and who your customers are
- What you want the website to accomplish (leads, sales, information, credibility)
- Whether you have an existing site and what's wrong with it
- Rough budget range and timeline
- Any specific features you need (ecommerce, booking, multilingual, integrations)

The studio should be asking you questions, not presenting a generic pitch deck. If they're selling before they understand your needs, that's a flag.

### Proposal and Scope (1–5 business days after the call)

A serious studio sends a written proposal that includes:
- **Project scope:** what's included and what's not
- **Technology recommendation:** what they'll build with and why
- **Timeline:** phases with estimated dates
- **Deliverables:** specific outputs at each stage
- **Pricing:** itemized, showing what each component costs
- **Payment schedule:** typically split across milestones
- **What they need from you:** content, brand assets, feedback timelines
- **Post-launch support:** what's included and for how long

If a proposal is one page with a total price and a "let's get started," it's not enough. You need clarity on scope to avoid disputes later.

### Payment Structure

Standard payment splits in the industry:
- **50/25/25:** 50% upfront, 25% at design approval, 25% at launch
- **33/33/33:** thirds at start, midpoint, and launch
- **Monthly billing:** some studios bill monthly based on hours spent

Avoid paying 100% upfront. A deposit of 30–50% is standard and reasonable.

## Phase 1: Research and Strategy (1–2 weeks)

Before any design work begins, the studio should spend time understanding your business context:

- **Competitor analysis:** what your competitors' websites do well and where they're weak
- **Audience research:** how your target customers search for and evaluate businesses like yours
- **Keyword research:** what search terms to target (relevant for both Google and AI search engines)
- **Content planning:** what pages the site needs, what content goes on each page, and how the information should be organized
- **Technical requirements:** any integrations, third-party services, or specific functionality

The output of this phase is usually a sitemap (list of pages and how they connect) and a content brief (what goes on each page). This is where the strategy work happens that differentiates a custom site from a template — the site structure is built around how your specific customers think and search, not around a generic template layout.

**What you'll need to provide:** Background on your business, your competitive landscape, examples of sites you like and dislike, any existing brand guidelines, and access to any analytics or data from your current site.

## Phase 2: Design (2–3 weeks)

### Wireframes

The studio creates wireframes — simplified layouts showing the structure and hierarchy of each page without visual design. This is where you review how information is organized, what the user flow looks like, and whether the right content is prioritized.

Wireframes look basic on purpose. The goal is to get the structure right before adding visual polish.

### Visual Design

Once wireframes are approved, the studio creates high-fidelity mockups — usually for 3–5 key pages (homepage, services page, about page, contact page, and one content/blog page). These show the actual visual design: colors, typography, imagery, spacing, and layout.

**Standard process:** the studio presents one design direction (sometimes two). You provide feedback. They revise. Two to three rounds of revisions on the design is standard. If you're on round five and it still doesn't feel right, there's usually a communication problem that needs addressing directly.

**What you'll need to provide:** Brand assets (logo, colors, fonts if you have brand guidelines), photos or direction on photography style, feedback on the wireframes and design within the agreed timeline. Delayed feedback is the most common cause of project delays.

## Phase 3: Development (3–5 weeks)

This is where the approved design gets built into a working website. The studio sets up:

- Frontend development (the visual interface users interact with)
- Backend/CMS integration (so you can update content without a developer)
- Responsive design (making sure everything works on mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- Performance optimization (image compression, lazy loading, caching)
- SEO technical setup (meta tags, schema markup, sitemap, robots.txt)
- Any specific functionality (forms, booking, ecommerce, integrations)

During development, you'll typically have access to a staging site — a private URL where you can see progress and test functionality before it goes live.

**What you'll need to provide:** Written content for all pages (this is critical — if you don't have content ready when development finishes, the project stalls). Photos and media. Credentials for any third-party services that need integration (payment processors, email marketing, analytics).

## Phase 4: Review and Testing (1–2 weeks)

Before launch, both you and the studio review the site:

- **Functionality testing:** every link, form, button, and interactive element
- **Cross-browser testing:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- **Device testing:** multiple phone sizes, tablets, desktop
- **Performance testing:** PageSpeed scores, load times
- **Content review:** checking all text, images, and links
- **SEO verification:** meta tags, schema markup, sitemap

The studio handles the technical testing. Your role is to review the content, test the user experience, and confirm that everything matches what was agreed in the proposal.

## Phase 5: Launch

Launch day typically involves:
- Pointing your domain to the new hosting
- SSL certificate activation
- Final performance checks
- Analytics and tracking verification
- Redirects from old URLs (if migrating from an existing site)

A good studio handles all of this. You shouldn't need to touch DNS settings or server configurations unless you want to.

## After Launch

### Post-Launch Support (typically 30 days included)

Most studios include a support period after launch to fix any bugs, make minor adjustments, and resolve issues that come up with real-world usage. Clarify what's included: is it unlimited fixes for bugs, or a set number of hours?

### Ongoing Maintenance (optional, monthly fee)

After the support period, websites need ongoing attention:
- Security updates and monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- CMS and plugin updates
- Content updates (if you need help)
- Analytics review and reporting

Studios typically offer maintenance packages ranging from $100–500/month depending on scope.

### Training

The studio should train you (or your team) on how to use the CMS to update content, add blog posts, manage products, or make other routine changes. This is usually a 30–60 minute recorded session. If a studio builds a site you can't update without calling them for every change, that's a problem.

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery & proposal | 1–2 weeks | Initial call, written proposal, agreement |
| Research & strategy | 1–2 weeks | Competitor analysis, keyword research, sitemap, content plan |
| Design | 2–3 weeks | Wireframes, visual design, revisions |
| Development | 3–5 weeks | Building the site, CMS setup, functionality |
| Review & testing | 1–2 weeks | QA, cross-browser/device testing, content review |
| Launch | 1–2 days | Go live, DNS, SSL, final checks |

**Total: 8–14 weeks** for a typical small-to-medium business website. More complex projects (web applications, ecommerce with many products, multilingual sites) take longer.

## Ready to Start a Project?

This is how we work at Kreatale. Every project follows this structure: discovery, research, design, development, testing, launch, and post-launch support. We provide written proposals with clear scope and pricing, you own the code and all assets, and we include 30 days of support after launch.

You can see examples of our finished work in our [project portfolio](/projects) — from marketing sites like [Sy Grace](/projects/sy-grace) to web applications like [Gemoedje.nl](/projects/gemoedje) to ecommerce like [Zushino](/projects/zushino). Each one went through this exact process.

If you have a project in mind and want to understand what it would involve and cost, the first step is a conversation.
