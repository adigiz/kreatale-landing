# How to Evaluate a Web Developer Before You Hire One

Hiring the wrong developer is expensive. Not just the money lost on a bad build, but the months of delay and the cost of hiring someone else to fix it or start over. Only 29% of IT projects meet their scope, timeline, and budget targets.

This article covers what to check before you commit, with specific red flags and green flags based on what we've seen in the industry.

## Check Their Own Website First

This is the fastest filter. Open the developer or agency's own website on your phone and evaluate:

- **Load speed.** If their own site is slow, your site will be slow. Run it through [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). Anything under 70 on mobile is a warning sign.
- **Mobile experience.** Is the text readable without zooming? Do buttons work with a thumb? Does it feel like it was designed for mobile, or is it a shrunken desktop site?
- **Content quality.** Is the copy clear and specific, or is it generic ("We deliver innovative digital solutions")? Vague copy on their own site usually means vague thinking on your project.
- **Working links and forms.** Broken links, placeholder content, or a contact form that doesn't work are signs of how much care they put into details.

If they can't get their own site right, they won't get yours right.

## Verify the Portfolio

A portfolio is the most important evaluation tool, but also the one most easily faked. In 2026, some agencies use AI-generated mockups or claim projects they didn't build.

**What to actually do:**

- **Visit the live URLs.** Don't just look at screenshots. Open every portfolio site on your phone and desktop. Check if they're still live, still fast, and still look good.
- **Check the footer.** Many agencies include a "Built by [Agency Name]" credit in the footer of client sites. If it's not there, ask why. It might be a client preference, but it might also mean they didn't build it.
- **Test the performance.** Run 2-3 portfolio sites through PageSpeed Insights. If they consistently score above 80 on mobile, that's a good sign. If they score below 60, they're not prioritizing performance.
- **Look for variety and relevance.** If every project in their portfolio looks the same, they're probably applying one template with minor variations. Look for a range of designs that feel tailored to each client's brand and audience.
- **Check the dates.** A portfolio full of projects from 2021-2022 with nothing recent suggests either a skills gap or a business that's struggling to get clients.

## Ask the Right Questions

Before signing anything, get clear answers to these:

**"What technology will you use, and why?"**
A good developer recommends technology based on your project needs — not whatever they happen to know. If someone pushes WordPress for everything, or pushes a custom framework for a simple 5-page site, they're fitting your project to their skills rather than the other way around. Ask them to explain why their recommended technology is right for your specific situation.

**"Who owns the code when the project is done?"**
This should be you. If a developer builds on a proprietary platform that only they can maintain, or if the contract says they retain ownership of the code, you're locked in. Make sure you get full access to the codebase, hosting accounts, and domain registration.

**"What does 'revisions' mean in your process?"**
Two to three rounds of design revisions is standard. "Unlimited revisions" sounds generous but often means scope isn't well-defined, which leads to projects dragging on with unclear endpoints. Ask for a specific process: how many design concepts, how many rounds of feedback, what constitutes a "revision" versus a "change in scope."

**"What happens after launch?"**
Websites need ongoing maintenance — security updates, performance monitoring, content updates, bug fixes. Ask whether post-launch support is included and for how long, what ongoing maintenance costs look like, and what happens if something breaks at 2 AM on a Saturday.

**"Can I talk to a recent client?"**
Any developer confident in their work will provide references. Ask for 1-2 references from the past 6-12 months. When you call them, ask: "Was the project delivered on time and on budget? How was communication during the project? Were there surprises? Would you hire them again?"

## Red Flags

Watch for these during the evaluation:

- **No written proposal or scope document.** A verbal agreement on "we'll build you a website" without written scope, timeline, milestones, and pricing is how projects go off the rails.
- **Significantly lower price than everyone else.** If you get 5 quotes and one is 60% cheaper, that's not a bargain. Either they're cutting corners, underestimating the scope, or planning to upsell you later.
- **Can't explain their process.** A developer should be able to walk you through their process step by step: discovery, design, development, testing, launch, handoff. If they describe it vaguely or skip phases (especially testing), expect problems.
- **Pushes a specific platform without asking about your needs first.** Technology should serve your goals, not the other way around.
- **No version control or staging environment.** They should use Git (or similar) for code management and have a staging environment where you can review work before it goes live. Without these, you're flying blind.
- **Disappears for days during the presale process.** How they communicate before you pay them is the best-case scenario for communication. It only gets worse from there.

## Green Flags

These suggest a developer or agency who takes their work seriously:

- **They ask you a lot of questions before quoting.** Good developers want to understand your business, your audience, and your goals before recommending a solution. If someone quotes a price after a 15-minute conversation, they're guessing.
- **They tell you what you don't need.** A developer who suggests a simpler (cheaper) approach because it fits your actual requirements better is one you can trust.
- **Clear, itemized pricing.** A breakdown showing design, development, testing, deployment, and any ongoing costs. Not just "website: $5,000."
- **They demonstrate their own technical standards.** Their own site is fast, well-designed, and works perfectly on mobile. Their portfolio shows consistent quality across projects.
- **They have a post-launch plan.** They talk about maintenance, monitoring, and iterating on the site after launch — not just the build.

## Hiring a Developer or Studio?

At Kreatale, we're transparent about our process, pricing, and capabilities. Every project starts with a discovery conversation to understand your business and goals before we recommend a technology or quote a price.

We provide written proposals with clear scope, timelines, and itemized pricing. You own the code. You get access to the Git repository, hosting accounts, and all credentials. We include 30 days of post-launch support with every project, and we offer ongoing maintenance for clients who want it.

If you want to see how we work, check our [portfolio](/projects) — browse projects like [Gala Esports](/projects/gala-esports) (Next.js gaming site), [Gemoedje.nl](/projects/gemoedje) (therapist search platform), or [Zushino](/projects/zushino) (ecommerce). Every project is live and you can run them through PageSpeed Insights yourself.
